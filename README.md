# Bubble Detection Using Image Processing Techniques

The aim of this code is to identify bubbles that have been sheared by a mechanical dispersant, where bubble recognition is necessary to evaluate the efficiency of the dispersant.  
However, the workflow implemented in this code is general and can be applied to bubble detection in a wide range of cases, whether for industrial applications or academic studies.
